table. Focus on Primary Key and the Foreign Key.

## Experiment 3 ##
###### Title :
To understand and use SQL Sub-Query.
###### Objective : 
To understand the use of sql subquery.

## Experiment 4 ##
###### Title :
Use of Inbuilt functions and relational algebra operations. 
###### Objective : 
To understand the use of inbuilt function and relational algebra with sql query.

## Experiment 5 ##
###### Title :
Use of different SQL clauses and JOIN. 
###### Objective : 
To understand the use of group by and having clause and execute the SQL commands 
using JOIN.

## Experiment 6 ##
###### Title :
To understand the concepts of Views. 
###### Objective : 
Students will be able to implement the concept of views.

## Experiment 7 ##
###### Title :
To understand the concepts of Index.
###### Objective : 
Students will be able to implement the concept of index.
###### Tasks covered in this experiment:
1) Create an index of name employee_idx on EMPLOYEES with column Last_Name, 
Department_id 
2) Find the ROWID for the above table and create a unique index on employee_id column of 
the EMPLOYEES.
3) Create a reverse index on employee_id column of the EMPLOYEES.
4) Create a unique and composite index on employee_id and check whether there is duplicity 
of tuples or not.
5) Create Function-based indexes defined on the SQL functions UPPER(column_name) or 
LOWER(column_name) to facilitate case-insensitive searches(on column Last_Name).
6) Drop the function based index on column Last_Name.

## Experiment 8 ##
###### Title :
To understand the concepts of Sequence.
###### Objective : 
Students will be able to implement the concept of sequence.
###### Tasks covered in this experiment:
1) Create a sequence by name EMPID_SEQ starting with value 100 with an interval of 1.
2) Write a SQL command for finding the current and the next status of EMPID_SEQ.
3) Change the Cache value of the sequence EMPID_SEQ to 20 and maxvalue to 1000.
4) Insert values in employees table using sequences for employee_id column.
5) Drop sequence EMPID_SEQ. 
6) Create a sequence called reverse to generate numbers in the descending order from 10000 
to 1000 with a decrement of 5.

## Experiment 9 ##
###### Title :
To understand the concepts of PL/SQL programming.
###### Objective : 
Students will be able to implement the basic concepts of Pl/SQL.
###### Tasks covered in this experiment:
1) Write a PL/SQL code to accept the value of A, B & C display which is greater.
2) Using PL/SQL Statements create a simple loop that display message “Welcome to PL/SQL 
Programming” 20 times.
3) Write a PL/SQL code block to find the factorial of a number.
4) Write a PL/SQL program to generate Fibonacci series.
5) Write a PL/SQL code to fund the sum of first N numbers.
